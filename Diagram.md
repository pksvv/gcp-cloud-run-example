Exporting Diagrams (PlantUML â†’ SVG/PNG)

PlantUML diagrams can be exported directly to SVG or PNG.

1. PlantUML Online
	â€¢	Open PlantUML Online Editor.
	â€¢	Paste your code â†’ Download as SVG or PNG.

2. VS Code + PlantUML Extension
	â€¢	Install PlantUML extension.
	â€¢	Open .puml file â†’ Right-click â†’ Export Current Diagram â†’ Choose SVG.

3. CLI (Local Install)
	â€¢	Install:
	â€¢	Mac: brew install plantuml
	â€¢	Ubuntu: sudo apt install plantuml
	â€¢	Export SVG:
	â€¢	plantuml -tsvg diagram.puml
	â€¢	Export PNG:
	â€¢	plantuml -tpng diagram.puml

âœ… SVG Advantage: Scales without pixelation, perfect for docs, slides, and web apps.

When to Use Different Diagramming Tools

ðŸŸ¢ PlantUML
	â€¢	Best for enterprise diagrams (component, class, deployment, C4 model).
	â€¢	Supports swimlanes in activity diagrams (good for process flows).
	â€¢	Strong theming and export options (SVG/PNG/PDF).

ðŸ”µ D2 (Terrastruct)
	â€¢	Modern, clean syntax DSL for diagrams.
	â€¢	Best when you want auto-layout and fast prototyping.
	â€¢	Swimlanes can be simulated using group or container blocks.
	â€¢	Works well for docs and modern developer tooling.

ðŸŸ£ Python Diagrams (Mingrammer)
	â€¢	Write diagrams in Python code.
	â€¢	Perfect for infrastructure architecture (AWS, GCP, Azure icons included).
	â€¢	Use when you need cloud infra visualization with official icons.
	â€¢	Less suited for swimlanes, but can group elements with clusters.

â¸»

Swimlanes
	â€¢	In PlantUML: use activity diagrams with |LaneName| to separate flows.
	â€¢	In D2: use group blocks to simulate swimlanes.
	â€¢	Useful when showing end-to-end workflows across Frontend, Backend, Data, and LLM layers.

ðŸ“Œ Rule of Thumb
	â€¢	PlantUML â†’ Formal enterprise docs, architecture reviews.
	â€¢	D2 â†’ Quick, modern, and clean diagrams for developer-centric docs.
	â€¢	Mingrammer Diagrams â†’ Infrastructure (cloud resources, services, network maps).
